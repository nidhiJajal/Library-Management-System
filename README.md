To set up the Library Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
### On Windows

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
### On macOS/Linux
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Library Management System:
Ensure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.
```bash
python main.py
```
If your entry point file is named something else (e.g., 'library_system.py'), adjust the command accordingly.

### 2. Interact with the System:
Follow the on-screen instructions to add books, borrow books, return books, and view available books.

## Running Tests
To ensure everything is working correctly, run the tests using 'pytest':
```bash
pytest
```
Ensure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed before running the tests.
